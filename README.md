# **`Terminology`**

- VA : Virtual Address
- PA : Physical Address
- PD : Page Directory
- PDE : Page Directory Entry
- PT : Page Table
- PTE : Page Table Entry
- PPN : Physical Page Number

# **`Overview of page table`**

All process works on virtual address. Machineâ€™s RAM is physical address. Page Table maps virtual address to physical address. 

Xv6 does this in 2 steps.

# **`Memory Layout`**

## **Kernel Only Memory**

![Untitled](xv6%20memory%20management%20walkthrough%2052f10c25c9dd4de39e601e386e6a1788/Untitled%202.png)

- virtual memory > `KERNBASE` (0x8000 0000) is for kernel
- always mapped as kernel-mode only
    - check `PTE_U` fag
    - **protection fault** for user-mode programs to access
- **physical memory address** `N` is mapped to `KERNBASE+N` or `0:PHYSTOP` to `KERNBASE:KERNBASE+PHYSTOP`
    - Note that although the size of physical memory is 4 GB, only 2 GB can be used by Xv6
- kernel code loaded into contiguous physical addresses

## **User Only Memory**

Each process has separate page table. For any process, user memory VA range is `0:KERNBASE` where `KERNBASE` is 0x80000000 i.e. 2 GB of memory is available to process.

![Untitled](xv6%20memory%20management%20walkthrough%2052f10c25c9dd4de39e601e386e6a1788/Untitled%203.png)

- The kernel code doesnâ€™t exactly begin at `KERNBASE`, but a bit later at `KERNLINK`, to leave
some space at the start of memory for **I/O devices**. Next comes the kernel **code+read-only** data from the kernel binary. Apart from the memory set aside for kernel code and I/O devices, the **remaining memory is in the form of free pages** managed by the kernel. When any user process requests for memory to build up its user part of the address space, the kernel allocates memory to the user process from this free space list. That is, most physical memory can be mapped twice, once into the kernel part of the address space of a process, and once into the user part.

## **`P2V` and `V2P`**

- `V2P(a)` (virtual to physical)
    - convert **kernel address** `a` to **physical address**
        - subtract `KERNBASE` (0x8000 0000)
    
    ```cpp
    #define V2P(a) (((uint) (a)) - KERNBASE)
    ```
    
- `P2V(a)` (physical to virtual)
    - convert **physical address** `a` to **kernel address**
        - add `KERNBASE` (0x8000 0000)
    
    ```cpp
    #define P2V(a) ((void *)(((char *) (a)) + KERNBASE))
    ```
    

# **`Functions of interest {Part 1 : building blocks}`**

## **`PGROUNDUP`**

What it does is round the address up as a multiple of page number i.e. do a CEIL type operation.

```cpp
#define PGROUNDUP(sz)  (((sz)+PGSIZE-1) & ~(PGSIZE-1))
```

`PGROUNDUP(620)` â†’ ((620 + (1024 -1)) & ~(1023)) â†’ 1024

## **`PGROUNDDOWN`**

another related function is `PGROUNDDOWN` , works similarly. just makes the address round down as a multiple of page number

```cpp
#define PGROUNDDOWN(a) (((a)) & ~(PGSIZE-1))
```

`PGROUNDDOWN(2400)` â†’ (2400 & ~(1023)) â†’ 2048

## **`switchuvm`**

- `u` here stands for user
- basically OS loads the user process information to run it
- loads process's Page Table toÂ `%cr3`

## **`kalloc`**

This function is responsible to return an address of one **new, currently unused** page (4096 byte) in RAM. `kalloc` removes first free page fromÂ `kmem` and returns its (virtual!) address, where `kmem` points to the head of a list of free (that is, available) pages of memory.

**Failure :** If it **returns 0**, that means there are no available unused pages currently. 

## **`walkpgdir`**

Main job of this function is to get the content of 2nd level PTE. This is such an important function that we will go line by line.

```cpp
static pte_t *
walkpgdir(pde_t *pgdir, const void *va, int alloc)
{
  pde_t *pde;
  pte_t *pgtab;

  pde = &pgdir[PDX(va)]; // PDX(va) returns the first 10 bit. pgdir is level 1 page table. So, pgdir[PDX(va)] is level 1 PTE where there is PPN and offset
  if(*pde & PTE_P){ // not NULL and Present
    pgtab = (pte_t*)P2V(PTE_ADDR(*pde)); // PTE_ADDR return the first 20 bit or PPN. PPN is converted to VPN for finding 2nd level PTE. pgtab is level 2 page table
  } else {
    if(!alloc || (pgtab = (pte_t*)kalloc()) == 0)
      return 0;
    // Make sure all those PTE_P bits are zero.
    memset(pgtab, 0, PGSIZE);
    // The permissions here are overly generous, but they can
    // be further restricted by the permissions in the page table
    // entries, if necessary.
    *pde = V2P(pgtab) | PTE_P | PTE_W | PTE_U;
  }
  return &pgtab[PTX(va)]; // PDX(va) returns the second 10 bit. So, pgtab[PTX(va)] is level 2 PTE where there is PPN and offset
}
```

### **Case 1 : when no allocation needed (`alloc = 0`)**

Recall that

```cpp
// +--------10------+-------10-------+---------12----------+
// | Page Directory |   Page Table   | Offset within Page  |
// |      Index     |      Index     |                     |
// +----------------+----------------+---------------------+
//  \--- PDX(va) --/ \--- PTX(va) --/
```

![Untitled](xv6%20memory%20management%20walkthrough%2052f10c25c9dd4de39e601e386e6a1788/Untitled%205.png)

- `PDX(va)` returns the first 10 bit. `pgdir` is level 1 page table. So, `pgdir[PDX(va)]` is level 1 PTE where there is PPN and offset
    
    ```cpp
    pde = &pgdir[PDX(va)];
    ```
    
- `PTE_ADDR` return the first 20 bit or PPN. PPN is converted to VPN using `P2V` for finding 2nd level PTE. `pgtab` is level 2 page table
    
    ```cpp
    pgtab = (pte_t*)P2V(PTE_ADDR(*pde));
    ```
    
- `PDX(va)` returns the second 10 bit. So, `pgtab[PTX(va)]` is level 2 PTE where there is PPN and offset
    
    ```cpp
    &pgtab[PTX(va)];
    ```
    

### **Case 2 : creating second-level page tables (When `alloc = 1`)**

- return **NULL** if **not trying to make new page table** otherwise use `kalloc` to allocate it
    
    ```cpp
    if(!alloc || (pgtab = (pte_t*)kalloc()) == 0)
        return 0;
    ```
    
- clear the new second-level page table. Make sure all those **`PTE_P`** bits are zero.
    
    ```cpp
    memset(pgtab, 0, PGSIZE);
    ```
    
- now that we have made the 2nd level page table, we have to put that address in 1st level page table. plus add some flags
    
    ```cpp
    *pde = V2P(pgtab) | PTE_P | PTE_W | PTE_U;
    ```
    

## **`mappages`**

```cpp
static int
mappages(pde_t *pgdir, void *va, uint size, uint pa, int perm)
{
  char *a, *last;
  pte_t *pte;

  a = (char*)PGROUNDDOWN((uint)va);
  last = (char*)PGROUNDDOWN(((uint)va) + size - 1);
  for(;;){
    if((pte = walkpgdir(pgdir, a, 1)) == 0)
      return -1;
    if(*pte & PTE_P)
      panic("remap");
    *pte = pa | perm | PTE_P;
    if(a == last)
      break;
    a += PGSIZE;
    pa += PGSIZE;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

As the name suggests, `mappages` adds a mapping from the virtual address (starting from given `VA` to `VA+SIZE`) to the physical address (starting from given `PA` to `PA+SIZE`) 

- for each virtual page in range, **get its page table entry**. if 2nd level not present allocate it (recall `alloc=1` case of `walkpgdir`). failure happens if runs out of memory
    
    ```cpp
    if((pte = walkpgdir(pgdir, a, 1)) == 0)
          return -1;
    ```
    
- make sure itâ€™s not already set
    
    ```cpp
    if(*pte & PTE_P)
    		panic("remap");
    ```
    
- set page table entry to valid value pointing to physical page at `PA` with specified permission (`perm`) and `P` for present
    
    ```cpp
    *pte = pa | perm | PTE_P; // pa is first 20 bit, perm is flags, PTE_P is done to mark as present
    ```
    
- advance to next physical page (`PA`) and next virtual page (`VA`)
    
    ```cpp
    a += PGSIZE;
    pa += PGSIZE;
    ```
    

<!-- ## **`growproc`** -->

# **`Functions of interest {Part 2 : core functions}`**

## **`allocuvm`**

Allocates user virtual memory (page tables and physical memory) to grow process. This function is responsible to **increase** the user's virtual memory in a specific page directory  fromÂ `oldsz` toÂ `newsz` . This function used for initial allocation plus expanding heap on request

```cpp
int
allocuvm(pde_t *pgdir, uint oldsz, uint newsz)
{
  char *mem;
  uint a;

  if(newsz >= KERNBASE)
    return 0;
  if(newsz < oldsz)
    return oldsz;

  a = PGROUNDUP(oldsz);
  for(; a < newsz; a += PGSIZE){
    mem = kalloc();
    if(mem == 0){
      cprintf("allocuvm out of memory\n");
      deallocuvm(pgdir, newsz, oldsz);
      return 0;
    }
    memset(mem, 0, PGSIZE);
    if(mappages(pgdir, (char*)a, PGSIZE, V2P(mem), PTE_W|PTE_U) < 0){
      cprintf("allocuvm out of memory (2)\n");
      deallocuvm(pgdir, newsz, oldsz);
      kfree(mem);
      return 0;
    }
  }
  return newsz;
}
```

ReturnsÂ `newsz` if succeeded, 0 otherwise.

- walks the virtual address space between the old size and new size in page-sized chunks. For each new logical page to be created, it allocates a new free page from the kernel, and adds a mapping from the virtual address to the physical address by calling `mappages`
- allocate a new, zero page
    
    ```cpp
    mem = kalloc();
    ```
    
- add page to second-level page table, also do the allocation. recall that `mappages` call `walkpgdir` with `alloc = 1`
    
    ```cpp
    mappages(pgdir, (char*)a, PGSIZE, v2p(mem), PTE_W|PTE_U);
    ```
    
- There are indeed 2 cases where **this function can fail**:
    
    Case 1: `kalloc` (kernel allocation) function failed. This function is responsible to return an address of a **new, currently unused** page in RAM. If it **returns 0**, that means there are no available unused pages currently.
    
    Case 2: `mappages` function failed. This function is responsible of making the **new allocated page to be accessible by the process** who uses the given page directory by **mapping that page with the next virtual address available in the page directory**. If this function fails that means it failed in doing so, probably due to the page directory being already full.
    
    In both cases, `allocuvm` didn't managed to increase the user's memory to the size requested, Therefore, `deallocuvm` is undoing all allocations until the point of failure, so the virtual memory will remain unchanged, and returns an error it self.

# **`User Process Memory Management initialization`**

- `userinit(void)` â†’ creates the first user process known as `init`
    - `setupkvm`  : Set up kernel part of a page table
    - `inituvm` : allocates one physical page of memory, copies the `init` executable into that memory, and sets up a page table entry for the first page of the user virtual address space
    - When the init process runs, it executes the init executable, whose main function forks a shell and starts listening to the user
- all other case
    - created by the `fork` system call
        - calls `copyuvm` : memory image is setup as a complete copy of the parentâ€™s memory image
            - `setupkvm`
            - walks through the entire address space of the parent in page-sized chunks, gets
            the physical address of every page of the parent using a call to `walkpgdir`
            - allocates a new physical page for the child using `kalloc`
            - copies the contents of the parentâ€™s page into the childâ€™s page, **adds an entry to the childâ€™s page table** using `mappages`
            - returns the childâ€™s page table
        
        At this point, the entire memory of the parent has been cloned for the child, and the childâ€™s new page table points to its newly allocated physical memory
